        <p>Making the perfect pan seared steak takes a lot of practice. Getting the salt and pepper just right, properly drying the steak before cooking and the temperature you cook it at are all critical to the final product.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 steak</li>
            <li>1 pinch of salt</li>
            <li>1 pinch of pepper</li>
            <li>2 tbsp of butter</li>
            <li>Avocado or olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>If possible unwrap the steak and place it on a wire rack in the fridge overnight or at least for a few hours.</li>
            <li>When ready to cook pat the steak dry and then apply salt then pepper on both sides of the steak, be generous.</li>
            <li>Heat a pan to high heat while adding a high heat oil preferabbly avocado but olive also works.</li>
            <li>Once the pan is hot add the steak and cook for 2-3 minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>When both sides have a nice sear on them check the temp and add butter to the pan</li>
            <li>Baste the steak with the butter in the pan until it reaches the desired temp</li>
            <li>Remove the steak from the pan and let it rest for 5 minutes before serving</li>
        </ol>
